The below commands are designed for being passed from the master commander to
the dispatcher.  Therefore, the commands are quite general and do not focus
on specifics of the hardware implemenations.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:             Initialize All Submodules
Command Call Name:                  INIT_ALL
Arguments:                          NONE
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Initialization
Author:
Description: This command should be passed once per compeition from the
master commander to the dispatcher to signal that all initalizations should now
be performed and any errors logged.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:	            Go Forward
Command Call Name:                  GO_FWD
Arguments:                          m Meters
         The number of meters to go forward.
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Motion Displacement
Author:
Description: This command should be used to move the entire submerine m meters
forward.  That is to say, translate the submerine frame m meters along the x
axis in the submerine frame.  The number of meters can be negative to indicate
the displacement should be in reverse.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:	            Go Left
Command Call Name:                  GO_LEFT
Arguments:                          m Meters
         The number of meters to go right.
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Motion Displacement
Author:
Description: This command should be used to move the entire submerine m meters
to the right.  This keeps the current heading and simply shifts the submerine
m meters in the positive y axis in the submerine frame.  The nubmer of meters
can be negative to indicate the displacement should be along the negative
y axis instead.

submerine frame with the specified waypoint location.  The heading vector
of the submerine should be the same in the initial and final configurations
of the submerine.

Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Motion Displacement
Author:
Description: This command should be used to adjust the heading vector of the
submerine by adding the specified deltas to the existing roll, pitch, and yaw
and rotating the submerine keeping the origin in place to meet those
specifications.

Catagory:                           Vision Detection
Author:
Description: This command should be used to interface with the vision system
to find the yellow path that runs along the bottom of the competition pool.
This command should be used to determine if we have found a path or not.
If we have not found path, the subermine should rotated in a specified direction
that depends on the current task that the subermine has just accomplished.
Therefore, this command should be used in conjunction with the FOLLOW_PATH
command.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:             Follow Path
Command Call Name:                  FOLLOW_PATH
Arguments:                          d Meters
       The distance along the path vector for the subermine to travel along.
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Vision Detection
Author:
Description: This command should be used to accomplish the following after first
a call to FIND_PATH and therefore, this command should assume a path is found in
current vision field.  Once this is so, this command shall take the submerine
first keeping its rotation angle constant to the detected beginning of the path.
After arriving at this translation location, the subermine shall then change
its rotation angle to align with the detected direction of the path.  The final
step shall consist of the submerine following the detected direction for
the specified number of meters.  This command should make heavy use of other
previously defined commands.
