The below commands are designed for being passed from the master commander to
the dispatcher.  Therefore, the commands are quite general and do not focus
on specifics of the hardware implemenations.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:             Initialize All Submodules
Command Call Name:                  INIT_ALL
Arguments:                          NONE
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Initialization
Author:
Description: This command should be passed once per compeition from the
master commander to the dispatcher to signal that all initalizations should now
be performed and any errors logged.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:	            Go Forward
Command Call Name:                  GO_FWD
Arguments:                          m Meters
         The number of meters to go forward.
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Motion Displacement
Author:
Description: This command should be used to move the entire submerine m meters
forward.  That is to say, translate the submerine frame m meters along the x
axis in the submerine frame.  The number of meters can be negative to indicate
the displacement should be in reverse.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:	            Go Left
Command Call Name:                  GO_LEFT
Arguments:                          m Meters
         The number of meters to go right.
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Motion Displacement
Author:
Description: This command should be used to move the entire submerine m meters
to the right.  This keeps the current heading and simply shifts the submerine
m meters in the positive y axis in the submerine frame.  The nubmer of meters
can be negative to indicate the displacement should be along the negative
y axis instead.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:             Go To Waypoint
Command Call Name:                  GO_TO_WAY
Arguments:                          x Meters
         The x coordinate of waypoint location in submerine frame.
                                    y Meters
         The y coordinate of waypoint location in submerine frame.
                                    z Meters
         The z coordinate of waypoint location in submerine frame.
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Motion Displacement
Author:
Description: This command should be used to the align the origin of the
submerine frame with the specified waypoint location.  The heading vector
of the submerine should be the same in the initial and final configurations
of the submerine.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:             Set RPY
Command Call Name:                  SET_RPY
Arguments:                          r Radians
         The delta roll in radians to perform.
                                    p Radians
         The delta pitch in radians to perform.
                                    y Radians
         The delta yaw in radians to perofrm.
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
Catagory:                           Motion Displacement
Author:
Description: This command should be used to adjust the heading vector of the
submerine by adding the specified deltas to the existing roll, pitch, and yaw
and rotating the submerine keeping the origin in place to meet those
specifications.
================================================================================
Canonical Command Name:             Find Path
Command Call Name:                  FIND_PATH
Arguments:                          None
Returns:                            SUCCESS | FAILURE
